An imperfect - yet woking, and fully commented - implementation of Ju, Lossaso, Schaefer and Warren's Adaptive Dual Contouring algorithm.
Allows one to add primitives to a hull and contour the result as a single mesh.
Felle free to browse, use, re-use, comment, or improve this implementation.

For now, it works as it should, except that the octree generation produces artifacts.

Runs as a JMonkeyEngine 3 project (see links).
